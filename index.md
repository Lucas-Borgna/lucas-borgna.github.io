I am Research Associate at Imperial College working in the High Energy Physics Department at the [CMS](https://cms.cern/) experiment. I recently completed my PhD in Particle Physics and Data Intensive Sciences in the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment at CERN, with University College London. The work in my PhD allowed me to hone my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning and software development. Further details of my most recent experiences are shown below.

## Research Associate, Imperial College London (current position)

Straight after my PhD, I joined the High Energy Physics group at Imperial College as a post-doc. In this group I specialize in researching methods to accelerate algorithms that are used in the data acquisition and reconstruction of the CMS experiment. Currenlty I work on utilizing a custom version of the DBSCAN algorithm, accelerated by FPGA hardware, to reconstruct the location of where the primary interaction occured in the CMS detector. The challenge here is to be able to do this reconstruction with a determinstic latency at around 1 $\mu$s. Moreover, I also mentor PhD students working on using reinforcement learning to reconstruct the trajectories of particles faster than is currently possible. 

## Data Science Intern, Vortexa

As part of my PhD training in Data Intensive Sciences, I interned at Vortexa for 8 months. Vortexa is based in London and they specialize in providing real-time tracking of oil and gas vessels. One of the main challenges with maritime vessel data is that their GPS signal can sometimes be lost due to equipment failure or congestion. Sometimes the signal is lost for a significant amount of time and a vessel's port visit can be missed. Not only is this not ideal, but it also incurs alot of personpower to correct the data. The first project I worked on at Vortexa aimed to systematically solve this by using a machine learning model that would predict a port visit during a vessel's signal outage. The finalized model did well to predict the port visits and it resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of time analysts' would need to spend on correcting the data.

The second half of my internship was spent working with the predictions and market modelling team. I worked on a proof of principle project that aimed to forecast freight rates for different routes and vessels. To do this I decided to make use of the data that Vortexa has to describe the micro and macro-economic environment of the oil and gas shipping routes. Different models ranging from linear regression to LSTMs were used to provide forecasts and their performance varied depending on the shipping route and vessel type. Ultimately the discoveries made in this proof of principle period were useful to Vortexa as this has enabled them to pursue this project further and develop it into a new product offering for their clients.

During this internship I learned a lot of new industry standard tools such as: AWS, Airflow, docker and SQL. Moreover, I also became much more confident with the software development skills I already had, and it enabled me to work more effectively with a real world software production line.
