Listed below are my professional experiences. 

# Research Associate, Imperial College London (current position)

Straight after my PhD, I joined the High Energy Physics group at Imperial College as a post-doc. In this group I specialize in researching methods to accelerate algorithms that are used in the data acquisition and reconstruction of the CMS experiment. Currenlty I work on utilizing a custom version of the DBSCAN algorithm, accelerated by FPGA hardware, to reconstruct the location of where the primary interaction occured in the CMS detector. The challenge here is to be able to do this reconstruction with a determinstic latency at around 1 $\mu$s. Moreover, I also mentor PhD students working on using reinforcement learning to reconstruct the trajectories of particles faster than is currently possible. 

# Data Science Intern, Vortexa

As part of my PhD training in Data Intensive Sciences, I interned at Vortexa for 8 months. Vortexa is based in London and they specialize in providing real-time tracking of oil and gas vessels. One of the main challenges with maritime vessel data is that their GPS signal can sometimes be lost due to equipment failure or congestion. Sometimes the signal is lost for a significant amount of time and a vessel's port visit can be missed. Not only is this not ideal, but it also incurs alot of personpower to correct the data. The first project I worked on at Vortexa aimed to systematically solve this by using a machine learning model that would predict a port visit during a vessel's signal outage. The finalized model did well to predict the port visits and it resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of time analysts' would need to spend on correcting the data.

The second half of my internship was spent working with the predictions and market modelling team. I worked on a proof of principle project that aimed to forecast freight rates for different routes and vessels. To do this I decided to make use of the data that Vortexa has to describe the micro and macro-economic environment of the oil and gas shipping routes. Different models ranging from linear regression to LSTMs were used to provide forecasts and their performance varied depending on the shipping route and vessel type. Ultimately the discoveries made in this proof of principle period were useful to Vortexa as this has enabled them to pursue this project further and develop it into a new product offering for their clients.

During this internship I learned a lot of new industry standard tools such as: AWS, Airflow, docker and SQL. Moreover, I also became much more confident with the software development skills I already had, and it enabled me to work more effectively with a real world software production line.  

# Technical Student, CERN

My undergraduate programme required me to take a year out in industry to gain some work experience. I decided to take this opportunity to work at CERN as technical student, which was genuinely my first encounter particle physics. During this time, I worked in the ATLAS collaboration, where I focused on upgrades for the data acquisition systems. The project I worked on aim to reduce the amount of fake data that we were recording due to some backscattering (uninteresting) protons being interpreted as muons (interesting). This project involved the design of a new custom hardware sytsem based on FPGAs to implement additional logic to filter out these "fake" mouns and feed it into the data acquisition system of ATLAS. My main contribution was to design an FPGA firmware that reads and controls the state of all of the custom hardware to make sure the boards remain 100% operational. This was done using the VHDL programming language. The project was sucessful and the new hardware was installed in the ATLAS detector for Run-2 and is still being used for Run-3 today.    


# Finance Intern, Development Bank of Singapore

During my summer break in 2013, I was lucky enough to intern at the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) as a finance interm for the Private Banking business unit. This opportunity helped me to better understand the financial industry and it introduced me to business world. I worked on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) across the private banking business unit, which at the time was a new set of requirements made by the IRS. This project gave me an high level overview into many different aspects of the business units and how they need to be modified to comply with the new regulations. 

# Industrial Attachment, Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences

After my first year in engineering physics I spent my summer break in 2012 working at the then called [Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/isce2/about-us). This was a really interesting opportunity for me as it they had just unveiled the [X-ray Absorption Fine structure for catalysis (XAFCA)](https://ssls.nus.edu.sg/fac-xafca.html) beamline at the [Singapore Synchrotron Light Source](https://ssls.nus.edu.sg/index.html). My main contribution to this beamline was to develop various control software using LabVIEW so that the beamline can always operate at optimal levels.
