# Data Science Intern, Vortexa

As part of my PhD training in Data Intensive Sciences, I interned at Vortexa for 8 months. Vortexa is based in London and they specialize in providing real-time tracking of oil and gas vessels. One of the main challenges with maritime vessel data is that their GPS signal can sometimes be lost due to equipment failure or congestion. Sometimes the signal is lost for a significant amount of time and a vessel's port visit can be missed. Not only is this not ideal, but it also incurs alot of personpower to correct the data. The first project I worked on at Vortexa aimed to systematically solve this by using a machine learning model that would predict a port visit during a vessel's signal outage. The finalized model did well to predict the port visits and it resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of time analysts' would need to spend on correcting the data.


The first project I worked on at Vortexa was to develop a model that could predict the por
