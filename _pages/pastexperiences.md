Below are some of my previous internships along with a brief summary of all the work involved.

## Technical Student, CERN

My undergraduate programme required me to take a year out in industry to gain some work experience. I decided to take this opportunity to work at CERN as technical student, which was genuinely my first encounter particle physics. During this time, I worked in the ATLAS collaboration, where I focused on upgrades for the data acquisition systems. The project I worked on aim to reduce the amount of fake data that we were recording due to some backscattering (uninteresting) protons being interpreted as muons (interesting). This project involved the design of a new custom hardware sytsem based on FPGAs to implement additional logic to filter out these "fake" mouns and feed it into the data acquisition system of ATLAS. My main contribution was to design an FPGA firmware that reads and controls the state of all of the custom hardware to make sure the boards remain 100% operational. This was done using the VHDL programming language. The project was sucessful and the new hardware was installed in the ATLAS detector for Run-2 and is still being used for Run-3 today.    


## Finance Intern, Development Bank of Singapore

During my summer break in 2013, I was lucky enough to intern at the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) as a finance interm for the Private Banking business unit. This opportunity helped me to better understand the financial industry and it introduced me to business world. I worked on the implementation of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) across the private banking business unit, which at the time was a new set of requirements made by the IRS. This project gave me an high level overview into many different aspects of the business units and how they need to be modified to comply with the new regulations. 

## Industrial Attachment, Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences

After my first year in engineering physics I spent my summer break in 2012 working at the then called [Institute of Chemical Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/isce2/about-us). This was a really interesting opportunity for me as it they had just unveiled the [X-ray Absorption Fine structure for catalysis (XAFCA)](https://ssls.nus.edu.sg/fac-xafca.html) beamline at the [Singapore Synchrotron Light Source](https://ssls.nus.edu.sg/index.html). My main contribution to this beamline was to develop various control software using LabVIEW so that the beamline can always operate at optimal levels.
